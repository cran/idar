\title{Tabulate Marks in Neighbourhood of Every Point in a Point Pattern}
\description{
  For a sequence of radii defining different neighbourhood sizes, visit each point in a focal point pattern, find the neighbouring points in a target point pattern, and compile a frequency table of the marks of these neighbour points for each radii.
}

\usage{
  mitable(ppp1,ppp2,r)
  }

\arguments{
  \item{ppp1}{"Focal" point pattern (an \code{\link[spatstat.geom]{ppp}} object of \pkg{spatstat}) or a \link[base]{data.frame} with columns named "x" and "y"}
  \item{ppp2}{"Target" multivariate point pattern (an \code{\link[spatstat.geom]{ppp}} object of \pkg{spatstat}) or a \link[base]{data.frame} with columns named "x", "y", and "marks". The column "marks" wears the (species) name of each point}
   \item{r}{Vector with the sequence of radii (\emph{r>0}) that define different neiborhood sizes.}
}

\details{
Given both a "focal" and a "target" point patterns, \code{mitable} visits each point in the focal point pattern, finds the neighbouring points in the target point pattern, and compile a frequency table of the marks of these neighbour points, where the neibourhood is defined by circles orf radius \emph{r} around the focal points. From an ecological point of view, it provides a \enc{\emph{relevé}}{\emph{releve}} of the local community around each focal tree. It repeats the process for each provided \emph{r}.
}


\value{
  A list, with length = \emph{length(r)}. Within each element of the list, a matrix with dimensions \emph{np} X \emph{nsp}, where \emph{np} is the number of points of the focal point pattern and \emph{nsp} is the number of unique species (i.e., unique marks) in the target point pattern. Cell values in the matrix represent number of neighbours of the \emph{j} species for individual \emph{i} at the considered neibourhood size.
